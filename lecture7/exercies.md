# Exercies

## Debugging

1. Use `journalctl` on Linux or `log show` on macOS to get the super user accesses and commands in the last day. If there arenâ€™t any you can execute some harmless commands such as `sudo ls` and check again.

```(shell)
journalctl -S yyyy-mm-dd
```

2. Do [this](https://github.com/spiside/pdb-tutorial) hands on `pdb` tutorial to familiarize yourself with the commands. For a more in depth tutorial read [this](https://realpython.com/python-debugging-pdb).

```(text)
Just do the pdb tutorial and find the problems and fix them
```

3. Install [`shellcheck`](https://www.shellcheck.net/) and try checking the following script. What is wrong with the code? Fix it. Install a linter plugin in your editor so you can get your warnings automatically..

```(shell)
#!/bin/sh
## Example: a typical script with several problems
for f in $(ls *.m3u)
do
  grep -qi hq.*mp3 $f \
    && echo -e 'Playlist $f contains a HQ file in mp3 format'
done
```
Solution :

```(shell)
shellcheck scriptName.sh
```

4. (Advanced) Read about [reversible debugging](https://undo.io/resources/reverse-debugging-whitepaper/) and get a simple example working using [`rr`](https://rr-project.org/) or [`RevPDB`](https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2016/07/reverse-debugging-for-python.html)..

Solution :

```(shell)
Go through the links and try to accomplish so.
```
